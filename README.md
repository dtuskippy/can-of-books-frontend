# Project Name

**Author**: Alan Chelko, Stephen Clemmer
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Throughout this module, we are creating a small app to track what books have impacted you, and what’s recommended to read next.

Web applications essentially all work by managing data related to “resources”. The resources that an app cares about can be just about anything: a product for sale, an uploaded photo, a review, a bit of weather data… whatever it is that gets stored in a database. When the app provides the interface to create, read, update, and delete a resource, we refer to that as a CRUD app. Over the next few labs, you will build an app that has books as a resource.

Primarily, the project entailed working through CRUD / REST / Mongoose / Axios / Express:

    * CRUD: Create / REST: POST / Mongoose: Model.create() / Axios: axios.post() / Express: app.post()
    * CRUD: Read / REST: GET / Mongoose: Model.find() / Axios: axios.get() / Express: app.get()
    * CRUD: Update / REST: PUT / Mongoose: Model.findByIdAndUpdate() / Axios: axios.put() / Express: app.put()
    * CRUD: Delete / REST: DELETE / Mongoos: Model.findByIdAndDelete() / Axios: axios.delete() / Express: app.delete()

## Architecture

Backend: Express Server, Node.js and Mongoose/MondgoDB cloud deployment

## Team Agreement
Alan Chelko & Stephen Clemmer Team Agreement

### Conflict Resolution
For any potential conflicts, we plan to work things out on a consensual basis, but assuming a real conflict arises, we would plan to go through a pros and cons scrum session and weigh it from there.  We'll still strive to reach consensus.

### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Alan: some JS experience from earlier this year
Stephen: Feels more comfortable on the backend than the front end currently. Project management.

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?  
Generally, we'll tap the strengths of each member, but we do not want to silo anybody by any particular skill or lack of skill. We have decided to have Stephen drive on the backend and Alan drive on the front end

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?  
We will pair program for this project. Stephen driving on the backend, Alan driving on the front end. We will pause as needed to clarify the code. 


## Communication Plan

### What hours will you be available to communicate?
Target same hours as normal CF class hours: 9:00 - 17:00 PST.

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack, Remo, gmail.

### How often will you take breaks?
As needed

### What is your Git flow?
We will ACP at every functional component

#### Who merges PRs?
Alan will merge front end PRs. Stephen will merge backend PRs.
