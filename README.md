## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Throughout this module, we are creating a small app to track what books have impacted you, and what’s recommended to read next.

Web applications essentially all work by managing data related to “resources”. The resources that an app cares about can be just about anything: a product for sale, an uploaded photo, a review, a bit of weather data… whatever it is that gets stored in a database. When the app provides the interface to create, read, update, and delete a resource, we refer to that as a CRUD app. Over the next few labs, you will build an app that has books as a resource.

For today’s assignment, we are READ book data by connecting our front-end React app to a back-end Express server. Our Express server will connect to a Mongo database. We will need to make a “schema” in our back-end code to model how we want our data to look. We will then populate our database with “seed” data—some of our favorite books. When the front end makes a request to our server, our server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Our front end will display these results.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
